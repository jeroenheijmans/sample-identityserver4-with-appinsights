Example way of using ASP.NET Core, IdentityServer4, and AppInsights together.

## ⚠️ Notice about updates

Note that this repository is provided "as-is" and will most likely not receive any (security) updates.

## Notes

Some quick pointers:

- Create your own Application Insights resource and configure the telemetry key via `appsettings` or user secrets
- If you're using Visual Studio you may be able to see events stream by in the tooling too, depending on your edition

And finally: the lack of explicit further documentation is on purpose.
There's only a small amount of code, and no kind of documentation could describe what's going on better than the code could.
